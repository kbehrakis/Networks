# emailServer
Email server in python

Goal: Develop a simple mail client that sends email to any recipient. The client will need to
connect to a mail server, dialogue with the mail server using the SMTP protocol, and send an 
email message to the mail server.  


EmailSender: The basic mail client.  It prompts for users to enter information into the termial window.

EmailSender_withPopUp: This version implements a rudimentary pop-up graphic where users enter in their information.
